# Nearest Neighbors Algorithms From Scratch

This repository contains the complete code for my three-part Medium series on implementing nearest neighbor algorithms from scratch using Python.

## Series Overview

This educational series takes you on a journey from the fundamentals of nearest neighbor algorithms to advanced applications:

- **[Part 1: Building a Simple Nearest Neighbor Classifier](https://medium.com/your-username/article-link)** - Implementing the core algorithm and classifying cat and dog images
- **Part 2: Exploring Distance Metrics with CIFAR-10** - Diving deeper with a larger dataset and comparing distance functions
- **Part 3: KNN for Embeddings and GenAI Retrieval** - Applying nearest neighbor concepts to modern AI retrieval tasks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nearest-neighbors-from-scratch.git

# Navigate to the repository
cd nearest-neighbors-from-scratch

# Create environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib pillow jupyter lab
```

Then navigate to the notebook you want to run.

### Dataset Information

1. Uses a small custom dataset of cat and dog images (Available in this repo)
2. Uses the CIFAR-10 dataset (Download [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and store it in your Google Drive if accessing through Google Colab)
3. TBC
